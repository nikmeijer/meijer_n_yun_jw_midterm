<h2>New Cars are better</h2>

            <li><h4>Exterior</h4></li>
             <p>
            Modern cars have beautiful exterier. Its outline is stunning. Because the modern cars follow the latest car design trends, they fit for the taste of modern people well. A more aerodynamic shape compared to older cars increases fuel efficiency.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Interier</h4></li>
            <p>
            Modern cars' interior is future-oriented. The active use of lighting satisfies the aesthetic needs of the person in the car. The dashboard actively uses the latest digital technology to increase user convenience, bringing greater satifaction to the driver than in old cars. In particular, HUD and built-in navigation are functions that cannot be found in old cars.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Performance</h4></li>
            <p>
            With the advancement of automobile manufacturing technology, especially modern cars' engine performance has improved remarkably. As technologies for all mechanical parts such as suspension and brakes have been developed as well as engine performance, not only driving convenience but also driver and passenger safety have been improved significantly.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Reliability</h4></li>
            <p>
            Since the car is brand new, there are few breakdowns. It is also less expensive to maintain, as automakers offer long warranty periods and warranty services.
            </p>
            <li><h4>Economy</h4></li>
            <p>
            Although the price for first purchase of a new car is more expensive than an older car, the overall cost is much lower than owning an older car because the cost of maintaining the car is lower. Especially in the case of old cars, it is often difficult to find parts, so it may cost a lot to find them and replace it. Sometimes finding parts can take days and moths. So it costs a lot for the owner to rent other cars to use instead of his old car.

                </li>

                    <p>Old cars look WAYYYYY cooler! All the new cars being made look the same, and they're BORING. Today's Hondas and Mazdas would not turn heads, but an old Civic or RX-7 is any car guys dream. (I don't even need to mention old Datsun and Nissan vs the new cars they put out...) Unless you like muscle cars, in which case the new ones still don't do the trick, they just look like sedans! But the classics with their defined lines and huge engines can't be beat. And what about Italian cars? The old Lamborghini Countach or the Ferrari F40 are legendary. The same just can't be said about the trendy Lamborghini Aventador.</p>
                
                <li>
                    <h4>Interior</h4>
                </li>

                    <p>The refined feeling of classic luxury automobiles is unmatched by anything carmakers today could dream of. A quick google search of old Lexus interiors or that of the classics of european cars such as old BMW, Porsche, or Audi is enough to show a long forgotten time of quality luxury. With premium leather, suede, or even curduroy interiors, wooden trims and huge dashboards and steering wheels, these cars' interiors have a feeling incomparable to any other vehicle. And even the cheaper, budget friendly options have comfortable cushioned and/or upholstered seating that lasts a lifetime, and simple, easy to use features like radio, cassette, and if its more recent, then even air conditioning. There are 30 year old cars on the road today with no tears in the fabric at all, and AC blowing cold.</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Performance</h4>
                </li>

                    <p>Indisputably, car manufacturers used to have more freedom to make engines as powerful as possible. Now, emission laws are much stricter resulting in cars that may be more fuel efficient, but their performance is greatly sacrificed. There are many examples of old cars that outperform any vehicle on the road today. To start off, there is the early generations of the Nissan GTR. The GTR was built on the Nissan Skyline platform, which was just a regular japanese road car at the time. The GTR was different, with a new trim and new specs, a more powerful engine, this car won world championship races for several consecutive years until it was banned from racing for being TOO POWERFUL and given the nickname 'Godzilla' by the Austrailian news. And you may be thinking this is a fluke, but take a look at the cars on the road today! In every crowd of traffic a wide range of those cars are 15 years or older (mind you that just means 2007). There are also the old muscle cars with huge V8 and even whopping V10 engines. And what about the inline 6 engines? You don't see those around anymore but those made light little family sedans into race cars! And then theres the japanese cars which somehow manage to run to 300 000 kms and all they need is regular oil changes and maybe a starter replacement to get there.</p>

                    <h4>Reliability</h4>
                </li>
    
                    <p>Old cars that were cared for by their owners are still on the road today running strong! There are some old cars on the road reaching half a million kms without breaking a sweat! Sure there are some that are rusting or with destroyed engines, but if you look further into it you realize those are results of negligence or carelessness with vehicles which are machines that require consisten maintenance. Anything metal will rust if it isn't looked after, even the new cars (except the coposite ones). And the average milage in old japanese cars on the road is around 240 000 kms which is a LOT. And these cars are easy to fix and there are plently of parts around because the cars themselves have been around for a long time. This also means older cars are quicker and simpler to fix than new ones, with easier accessibility to the engine and parts. Plus compared to new cars that rely on electronics, old cars are all mechanical which means everything can be fixed easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.</p>

                    <h4>Economy</h4>
                </li>
        
                <p>Fuel Economy: No Comment. Financial Economy? Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! ... until its not. Unfortunately this is where these cars lose the debate. Unless you find a hidden gem of a car that was cared for by all its owners, you will find that an enticing price tag of 3000$ comes with the hidden expenses of repairs and maintenance and head gaskets and rotors and discs and calipers and rust and oil and fluids and transmission and more. So Economy? No. I still want an old car though!</p>
