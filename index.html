            With the advancement of automobile manufacturing technology, especially modern cars' engine performance has improved remarkably.

            Although the price for first purchase of a new car is more expensive than an older car, the overall cost is much lower than owning an older car because the cost of maintaining the car is lower. Especially in the case of old cars, it is often difficult to find parts, so it may cost a lot to find them and replace it. Sometimes finding parts can take days and moths. So it costs a lot for the owner to rent other cars to use instead of his old car.
